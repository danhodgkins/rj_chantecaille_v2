	Partner Text	vsC02		Enchanting and wildly colorful, these tiny pollinators are concentrated in the lush forests of Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil. Their forest home harbors a quarter of the world’s flora and fauna.<br><br>It stores massive amounts of carbon and helps stabilize global climate. <br><br>When the forest is healthy, hummingbirds flourish. And humans do too.

	Text Panel 3 Sub Heading	vsC09		BUT THE AMAZON IS VANISHING	
	Text Panel 3  Body	vsC10		The mightiest of the earth's rainforests is under siege. Enormous swaths of it are being burned and wiped away, exploited for oil, minerals and timber. And with it, the future of more than 1 million indigenous people - and generations of wisdom about the unique mysteries of the forest - are critically threatened.	
	Text Panel 4 Sub Heading	vsC11		THE AMAZON NEEDS OUR HELP	
	Text Panel 4  Body	vsC12		We believe that these ancient forests are best governed by their original guardians. That’s why Chantecaille has partnered with the <b>Amazon Conservation Team</b>,who work with indigenous and local communities to protect tropical forests and strengthen traditional culture. We are proud to support ACT’s efforts on behalf of ASOMI, an association of indigenous female elders and healers who live in the Andean Amazon of Colombia.<br><br>With our limited-edition Hummingbird Lip Chic, we’re raising $75,000 to help ASOMI buy back and protect 75 acres of their ancestral land.

		vsC14		HUMMINGBIRD COLLECTION	
		vsC15		Enchanting and wildly colorful, these tiny creatures-the smallest birds on Earth-are endemic to the Americas and concentrated in the lush forests of the Amazon. Our <b>Black-throated Mango</b>, which inhabits the jungles of South and Central America, and <b>Blue-tailed Emerald</b>, found in Western Ecuador and Colombia, are two of more than 150 species in the region.<br><br>Unique in the bird world, hummingbirds’ wings beat rapidly to help them hover in place to feed and pollinate, fly backwards, or dive at speeds of up to 60 mph. With ultra-fast metabolisms, they can consume double their weight daily in flower nectar and small insects. And hummingbirds have such sharp memories they may return to the same flower on the very same tree time and again. Their special powers have given them an indelible place in indigenous folklore as a totem of harmony and healing, and even as a go-between to the spiritual realm.<br><br>However, hummingbirds are highly sensitive to the effects of climate change, deforestation, and pesticide use. Like the proverbial canaries in the coalmine, they signal when the ecosystem is imbalanced. When a favorite species of tree vanishes, the bird may vanish too.<br><br>Together with the Amazon Conservation Team, we hope you will help us save their forest habitat.
